Next.js
-SSR React app
-ServerSideRenderingcan improve performance and UX by pre-rendering and sending fully formed HTML to client browser 
-->(consider React would be rendering on the client side after server sends code bundle. Next pre-renders.)
-->Forms of pre-rendering:
1. SSG [StaticSiteGeneration]/Static Generation (recommended) - HTML generated at build time and reused at each req. 
---Efficient, built on server, can be cached by CDN(ContentDeliveryNetwork).
2. SSR - HTML generated on each req
NOTE: Both are generated on the server. They can be combined with client-side fetching to create hybrid apps that use advantages of both forms.

-Automatically splits code into smaller chunks = easier and less time to load
-SEO optimization - linked to SSR; allows search engines to easily crawl and index pages
-Built in features speed up development eg. file-based routing (vs React Router), auto code splitting, built-in API routes, TS support
-Dev experience - eg. hot reloading, easy integration 
-Scalability - able to handle large-scale apps with features mentioned already as well as eg. caching, support for serverless functions.

pages/api folder for req BE 
app folder with pages FE


Layout + Routing
-simple routing - create dir for page you want to link/route to eg. app/about/page.tsx automatically creates route
-about/layout.tsx applies to all pages in app
-setup layout for specific tree eg

export default function AboutLayout({
	children,
}: {
	children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
	return <>{children}</>;
}

-when creating styles you can have global styles as well as specific styles using style modules eg. styles.module.css for each page/path in layout
(you can use the same name for identifiers with different styles in different style pages since they are based on context in which they are being used eg. .main{})

NOTE about 13.2.3 upgrade - fewer folders in app : no pages dir; everything is now in app dir - IMP changes to metadata 
https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata
-note: meta and link ltags would be defined in <head> HTML in layout/page but head is .js file is deprecated after 13.2
-(however in project am going over example using head.js file)
--> Static vs Dynamic metadata

Fetching data fundamentals
https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching
- RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. fetch data on server using Server components; 2. parallel data fetching; 3. (for layout/pages) fetch data where it is used [may see same fetch req more than once] --> Next will auto deduplicate requests in a tree and only make the req once; 4. use LoadingUI, Streaming, Suspense to progressively render page while content loads

Fetching with server components:
- differences you can control like static site generation, server side rendering, incremental static regeneration strategy etc.
-( static with props vs SSG static that use data/props)
- In dev mode you can't really tell if components are static server components or SSR components or apply any other data fetching strategies?
- If you run build (npm run build) instead of dev Next will tell you what type of components are being generated PROVIDES LOTS OF INFO ABOUT ROUTES(pages, app), LAYOUTS AND COMPONENTS + size and response time --> npm run start will use build that is created to get better idea of how app will respond
--> notice on network tab how instantly made reqs/pre-fetched and pre-rendered data for users in SSR pages even before mousing over compared to dev mode
*- we can use a strategy with our Next.js code for server side rendering since it won't know what req we are going to make (unlike static pages where it is auto pre-rendered)
